# wheather_station
CSV logs from commercial whether station and  wind analysis code in python

The python file plots wind roses for wind and gust values in the file.
It also calculates max values of wind and gust and mean wind speed.

Running `python3 wind_analyser.py` saves the resulting plot to `wind_rose.png`.

The file does not consider date and time column from the CSV log (which is actually important).
